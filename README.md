This project was made by a studrnt for a milestone assignment in the Software Development Bootcamp at UNLV. The objective of the assignment is to display all aspects of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and UX/UI design learned through the program thus far.



Many parts of the project were built off a pre existing code from Ryan Branco. A link to their article/work is here: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/creating-a-board-game-checkers-with-javascript-ecd562f985c2.
